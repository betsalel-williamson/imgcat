<h1>Core Principles</h1>
<p>ImgCat.io (officially: NC Blue Tool Analysis, LLC) was established in 2025, following the enshittification of the owner's favorite social media site. He searched for another community that was as friendly, welcoming, and as comminity-focused as he remembered, but couldn't find one. So he built it.</p>
<ul>
	<li>We do not sell your information, and protect it with modern tech</li>
	<li>We do sell ads, but try to be as privacy-focused as possible</li>
	<li>We collect as little data as we're allowed to, by law</li>
</ul>
<p>We built this site for the community, and their interests must come first.</p>
